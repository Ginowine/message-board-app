# Decentralized Message Board User Interface

This project provides a basic decentralized message board application built using React and the Ethereum blockchain. Users can connect their wallets, post messages, and view messages submitted by others.

## Setting Up the Project

Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- A MetaMask wallet or similar Ethereum wallet.
- Add Sepolia Testnet to Metamask
- Fund Metamask Sepolia with Test Ether

## Steps

### Clone the Repository:

Bash

`git clone https://github.com/Ginowine/message-board-app.git
cd message-board-app`

### Install Dependencies:

Bash

`npm install`

### Run the Application

`npm start`

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Project Functionalities:

This application allows you to:

- Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract.
- Post messages to the decentralized message board using the connected wallet.
- View a list of messages submitted by other users.

### Note:

This is a basic example and should not be used in production without further security audits and testing.
This project can be extended with features like:

- Upvoting or downvoting messages.
- Decentralized storage for message content (e.g., using IPFS).

### Contributing
This project is open source and I welcome contributions. Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements or additional features.
