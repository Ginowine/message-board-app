## Setting Up the Project

Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- A MetaMask wallet or similar Ethereum wallet.

Configure Smart Contract:

### Install Dependencies:

npm install
``` (or `yarn install` if using yarn)

### Run the Application

npm start
``` (or `yarn start`)

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Project Functionalities:

This application allows you to:

- Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract.
- Post messages to the decentralized message board using the connected wallet.
- View a list of messages submitted by other users.

### Note:

This is a basic example and can be extended with features like:

- Upvoting or downvoting messages.
- Decentralized storage for message content (e.g., using IPFS).
